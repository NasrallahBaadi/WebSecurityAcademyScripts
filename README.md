# WebSecurityAcademyScripts
Python and Bash scripts that automate the exploitation of Web Security Academy labs.

These scripts may not be perfect, but they represent my sincere effort to learn scripting and accomplish the task at hand. As I continue to learn and improve, I'll strive to enhance the code quality and implement best practices in my future projects.

I am open to feedback and advice, and I highly appreciate any suggestions that can help me improve my coding skills and the quality of my scripts. Feel free to provide your insights and recommendations. Thank you in advance for your valuable input!
